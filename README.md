Our project aims to create a music-sharing website specifically for University
of Washington students, designed to foster a community of music lovers. The
website will provide a platform where students can easily discover new music,
share their current favorites, and connect with peers who share similar tastes.
The primary users of the website will be UW students, particularly those passionate
about find new music or introducing others to their favorite songs.
