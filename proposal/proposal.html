        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Music is a tool for connection across all age groups, especially among college students. Since most people have some type of relationship with music, it serves as a bridge for students to engage with one another, regardless of their backgrounds. While services like <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/">Spotify Wrapped</a> offer individual music insights and <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> tracks global listening trends, neither provides location-specific experiences that allow students to connect through each other's musical tastes on their college campus. 
        </p>
        <p>
             Our website fills this gap by promoting community bonding through localized shared music trends. The lack of a communal platform that showcases what songs UW students are listening to in real-time presents a missed opportunity for music connection and exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
            While existing music-sharing apps offer global insights, none are tailored to specific communities, like college campuses. <em>UW Weekly Wrapped</em> solves this by compiling and presenting the top ten songs UW students are listening to each week. Students can contribute songs manually via a form with fields for song title, artist, genre, and an optional personal note, making the experience interactive and community-driven. Users can sort songs by genre or artist, view past wraps, and click on songs to listen on external platforms. By offering this real-time music-sharing space, we create spontaneous opportunities for interaction, enhancing the campus experience through music.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our project aims to create a music-sharing website specifically for University
            of Washington students, designed to foster a community of music lovers. The
            website will provide a platform where students can easily discover new music,
            share their current favorites, and connect with peers who share similar tastes.
            The primary users of the website will be UW students, particularly those passionate
            about find new music or introducing others to their favorite songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, the type of information our users will view is a list of songs. These lists of songs will be generated weekly from user input data. The list will consist of 10 songs along with their respective artists and genre representing “what University of Washington students are listening to this week”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our team believes our web app will promote UW community bonding because it creates a sense of belonging to a group/and or community by providing a shared language of rhythm and melody. UW is full of diverse students and music can connect people of all ages and backgrounds regardless of language. The weekly release of our list of songs will create excitement and new interests to share with peers.
